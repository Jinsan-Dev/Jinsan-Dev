Hi, I’m @Jinsan-Dev :)

I’m interested in Mobile Computing (Smartphone, Smartwatch and other IoT devices), Back-End, Big data and Machine learning.

In my opinion, there are 3 main skills that are needed to be a good developer & researcher.

The 1st one is the "PROBLEM SOLVING" skill.
As a developer or researcher, we need to persuade people who asked us like "WHY do we need your work/study?"
And I think the keyword of this is "LOGIC". The problem solving should be based on logic and go forward "logical" step by step.
I've done research named "Building-Level Location Track using Smartwatch". You can check details of it in my portfolio.

2nd one is "COMMUNICATION".
I have trouble-shooting experience of around 9 months (Apr ~ Dec, 2019). I released an application for ASD patients via Play Store & App Store. And handling a lot of feedbacks and errors.
I have been working for 3 years in an English-friendly environment. (In my lab, there are 3 Korean and 7 international colleagues.)
And I have worked at Texas A&M University as a dispatched researcher for 6 months. (Nov. 30. 2020 ~ May. 31. 2021)
All sorts of experiences train me to communicate as not only a domestic but also an international developer/researcher.

3rd one is "INITIATIVENESS"
As developer/researcher in computer science, specially, we faced new technologies everyday. Computer technology is often applied to seemingly unrelated areas such as power system(smart grids), medical treatment (Digital therapeuticcs) and so on. So, we need to be keep aggresive, initiative and embraceness.
I worked on cloud-base smart grid network implementation using IEEE 2030.5 protocol. And also joined digital therapeutics research.

Right now, I'm master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the Inha university.
I also have bachelor's degree for Computer Science and Engineering from Inha university.
